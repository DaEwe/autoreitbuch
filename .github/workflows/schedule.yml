    # If the schedule opens 4 weeks in advance, running weekly is fine.
    # User said "immer Samstags ... am besten drei Wochen im Voraus"
    # Assuming lessons open on a schedule, running daily or on specific days is best.
    # Let's run it daily at 07:00 UTC to match typical morning releases, or maybe just Saturdays?
    # To be safe and since it idemptotently checks, running daily is fine.
